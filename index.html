        <h4>Where is it?</h4>
        <p>One of the reasons we put QCM together was to showcase our favorite city, so
          of course we're hosting in an amazing venue downtown. The
          <a href="http://contemporaryartscenter.org/">Contemporary Arts Center</a> has
          awesome architecture, is full of great exhibits (did we mention that's included in
          your ticket?) and a crazy 45&deg; staircase!
        </p>
        <p>We've booked the venue for Thursday and Friday, so we're working on a great
          event for Thursday night with some familiar faces from around the city.
          That's included, too.</p>

        <h4>Design for Developers</h4>
        <p>Designers are designers and developers are developers and never the
          twain shall meet, right? Except – not really. There are some imaginary
          lines drawn around the two disciplines of design and development, but the
          truth is they are closely intertwined, and it can be very useful for a
          developer to have design knowledge and skills in his or her toolbox. This
          presentation will correct some commonly-held misconceptions about design,
          cover the basics of design from a developer’s perspective and explore how
          a developer can employ these principles to build clearer, cleaner and
          more usable applications.</p>
        <p>Jen Myers is a web/interface designer at the software company Relevance.
          She works from Columbus, Ohio, where she also teaches HTML/CSS and
          organizes the coding education program Girl Develop It Columbus. Her
          particular areas of interest are user experience, teaching innovation and
          using design as a tool for communication. She also likes good movies,
          comic books and frequently changing her hair color.</p>

        <h4>Top Ten Mistakes that Kill Companies</h4>
        <p>It is tough to an entrepreneur.  You are expected to understand
          every aspect of your business; everything from filing your business
          taxes to changing the toilet paper in your international
          headquarters.  On top of all of the stuff you are expected to
          understand, you will have to synthesize the clutter of advice and
          information you will receive.  The Lean Start-up model instructs
          entrepreneurs on how to eliminate some of the unnecessary
          distractions and focus on rapid iteration of a product.
          Unfortunately, your lawyer is likely anything but a lean start-up
          disciple.  You'll be receiving reams of paper for signature that will
          read like they were written by Robin Hood with a quill pen.  While
          being smarter than your lawyer would be great, lets focus on the top
          ten mistakes that could kill your company so that you can avoid any
          armageddon situations.   This discussion will focus on helping you
          avoid the company killing mistakes and coaching you to your minimal
          viable legal solution. No one wants to waste money on lawyers when
          there are more important business expenses (like upgrading the ramen
          noodles you bought in bulk).</p>

        <h4>Community</h4>
        <p>Etsy is an online bazaar for handmade goods, and one for the key
          aspects for the site itself is the Etsy communities and
          sub-communities that have and continue to form and grow. The Etsy
          development community is the group of smart engineers that grow and
          maintain the site that helps to facilitate these amazing Etsy
          communities. While these engineers are very smart, you should recall
          the old adage, "A stupid person is someone who never learns from his
          mistakes, a smart person is someone who learns from his mistakes, and
          a wise person is someone who learns from other mistakes." At Etsy we
          embrace learning from mistakes and sharing with others so that they
          may learn from these mistakes as well because we also know that no
          one is perfect. Here, I will share several of the bumps along the way
          that took us from being small yet bureaucratic to large and still
          growing with more community and emphasis on culture, all while
          maintaing that small startup feeling.</p>
        <p>Laura Beth "LB" Denker graduated from RIT with a BS/MS in
          Computational Mathematics/Computer Science. She then moved on to a
          small job in a small city in central New York before being courted by
          Google, bringing her to the Big Apple, where she worked in both test
          and development for over 4 years. Now she has taken a turn for
          handmade, helping Etsy grow its spectacular development culture and
          continuous deployment process as the self-proclaimed Anthropologist
          of Developer Culture.</p>

        <h4>Innovation Is Something You Feel</h4>
        <p>Innovating within an organization is a mystery, especially those
          within service industries. Why? Because innovation is something that
          you feel and not necessarily just something that you do. Making
          individuals feel something is a hard assignment. For service
          organizations there are limitations to our business model putting
          business practicality and unpaid innovation at odds. Yet, without
          investing in innovation, clients won’t pay for skills that you have
          not demonstrated—the ultimate chicken or egg question. In addition to
          the business challenges, there are a lot more practical questions as
          well, like where to start innovating? As we reflect on our year, we
          always realize how many hours went unbilled, unused every year. Many
          organizations just do not know where to start or how to create a plan
          for innovation. This talk will put actionable steps to innovating at
          any organization, focusing on the service industry, and discuss how
          to harness the power of the unbilled hour to innovate. Harnessing the
          energy of your organization has the ability to win new business,
          empower your teams and finally help people feel innovation.</p>

        <p>My name is Alex, I’m from Philadelphia, PA.</p>
        <p>I start things: businesses, conversations, parties, and sometimes a
          little trouble. I’m probably best known for starting Philadelphia’s
          Indy Hall coworking community in 2006, years before coworking became
          a darling of the mainstream press and workers everywhere. Since, Indy
          Hall and my work have been featured in national and international
          publications. I’ve started and contributed to conversations around
          the progress and methodologies behind my projects, making “open
          source” a reality for more than just software and helping countless
          aspiring catalysts around the world. Many credit me with their
          starts, citing my non-nonsense credo “JFDI” (just effing do it) as a
          source of inspiration to stop with the excuses and, well, JFDI.</p>
